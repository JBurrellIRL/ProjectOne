            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The Waterford Hiking Club was founded by a group of friends in 1992, with the aim of creating an
                enjoyable and safe atmosphere for local people to enjoy all aspects of mountaineering and hill
                climbing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since then, the club has prospered and grown, and now has a membership of around 85 people.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Anyone wishing to join one of our walks must contact the club
                secretary
                beforehand. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to join.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We have different grades of walks to suit hikers of all fitnesses and abilities. We're a social
                group
                that enjoys the outdoors and don't take things too seriously, outside of group safety of course!
                Which
                is always our
                number one priority.
            </p>

        <div id="right-column">
            <h2>Walk Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants in our club activities should be aware that they are responsible for their own
                        actions
                        and decisions. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for injuries sustained when
                        walking
                        with us.</li>
                    <li>Walk leaders are members of the club, with prior experience in both leading groups and also in
                        the
                        walking terrain. Bear in mind that
                        the leaders are all volunteers and should be respected as such.</li>
                    <li>Prospective new club members must contact the club Public Relations Officer in order to make
                        arrangements to come out with the walking club group. People turning up "on spec" will not be
                        accepted, so please contact us in advance to avoid disappointment.</li>
                    <li>It is irresponsible to go on a walk if you know in advance that you are unwell or injured. You
                        should select a walk
                        that matches your ability and fitness level on the day. If in doubt, err on the side of caution.
                        If
                        going on the walk you should, out of courtesy, inform the leader</li>
                    <li>Walk leaders reserve the right to divide a group into slow and fast walkers - however, this
                        should
                        not be an issue if everyone is on the correct walk for their ability level. If you go ahead of
                        the
                        leader on your own accord, then you acknowledge that you're no longer part of this walk and the
                        leader is no longer responsible for you.</li>
