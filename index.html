            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The Waterford Hiking Club was founded by a group of friends in 1987, with the aim of creating an
                enjoyable and safe atmosphere for local people to enjoy all aspects of mountaineering and hill
                climbing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since then, the club has prospered and grown, and now has a membership of around 85 people.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Anyone wishing to join one of our walks must contact the club
                secretary
                beforehand. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to join.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We have different grades of walks to suit hikers of all fitnesses and abilities. We're a social
                group
                that enjoys the outdoors and don't take things too seriously, outside of group safety of course!
                Which
                is always our
                number one priority.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div id="right-column">
            <h2>Walk Guidelines</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants in our club activities should be aware that they are responsible for their own
                    actions
                    and decisions. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for injuries sustained when
                    walking
                    with us.</li>
                <li>Walk leaders are members of the club, with prior experience in both leading groups and also in
                    the
                    walking terrain. Bear in mind that
                    the leaders are all volunteers and should be respected as such.</li>
                <li>Prospective new club members must contact the club Public Relations Officer in order to make
                    arrangements to come out with the walking club group. People turning up "on spec" will not be
                    accepted, so please contact us in advance to avoid disappointment.</li>
                <li>It is irresponsible to go on a walk if you know in advance that you are unwell or injured. You
                    should select a walk
                    that matches your ability and fitness level on the day. If in doubt, err on the side of caution.
                    If going on the walk you should, out of courtesy, inform the leader.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="center-column">
            <h2>Required Equipment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clothing:</strong>
                    People joining our walks must have hiking boots or strong, waterproof walking shoes. For longer
                    hikes, hiking boots are required.
                    Rain gear is also recommended, considering Ireland's changeable weather. A light waterproof jacket
                    and pants that can be stored in your carrier bag can always come in useful.
                    We do not allow people joining our walks to wear jeans or cotton-based tracksuits, as they absorb
                    moisture and can lead to illness.
                    For walks of over 3 hours duration, we recommend that people bring a change of clothes with them, in
                    case of a downpour.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Food & Drink:</strong>
                    Please bring a packed lunch, including fruit/snacks, water, and possibly a hot drink and some
                    high-energy snacks e.g. chocolate and/or peanuts.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Items which are also useful:</strong> A basic medical kit, a torch (in case of being stuck
                    out overnight) and a mobile phone in case an emergency phone call is needed. Our guides always bring
                    a compass and some emergency medical equipment, however, it's never any harm to bring these items
                    yourself.
